Mydelishdish is an application designed to help you find something to eat.  While regular restaurant review applications are common, they do not help you if you know what you want to eat, but not where to get it.

Mydelishdish aims to solve that problem!

Mydelishdish users rate individual dishes and provide a way to find what it is you want to eat.

App is currently very basic, but will be refined over time.
